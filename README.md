# ImmersiveLEDs
Thank you for coming to check out my mod. Im not good with READMEs yet so i hope a 'thanks' suffices.
I included my various and random comments littered about the code as to let you get an idea of what was racing through my head during development.
I wish you the best in traversing the minefield I call code.

*Please disregard the file named 'ExampleMod', it was only slightly modified by me. It came with the original example file setup from the Minecraft Forge website.
I did not get around to changing the name of the mod from 'ExampleMod' due to time constraints pushing me to work on other things. 
The one time I did attempt to change it my computer nearly burst into flames.*
